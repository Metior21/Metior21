- 🔭 I’m currently working on building skills as Data Analyst.<br>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code on Python.  <br>
- ⚡ I’m also pursuing Data Science.<br>
- 💬 I enjoy doing Automation(Selenium), use Pandas library, create a dashboard from end to end using python only (Dash, Plotly, sqlite3). <br>
- 😄 I like doing challenge questions on boot.dev and rank high on leaderboards, also looking into solving more questions on leetcode.<br>
